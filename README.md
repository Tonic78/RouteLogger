## Goals for this project

The goal of this project was to build an app using new technologies (see above) not taught in the bootcamp. I learned these new tools by reading documentations and watching tutorial videos.

- practice front-end and local database development
- practice learning new technology independently
- apply what we learned in the bootcamp
- showcase development approach of using wireframes and user stories
- practice disciplined git usage

## User stories

- As a user, I want to add a new location to my log.
- As a user, I want to give a title to my new location.
- As a user, I want to take a picture of the location. For that, I want to give the app permission to access the camera of my device.
- As a user, I want to the app to determine my current location. For that, I want to give the app permission to access the geolocation information from my device.
- As a user, I want to choose a location myself on the map.
- As a user, I want to see a list of all my stored locations.
- As a user, I want to see a detailpage when I select a stored location.

## Git

In this project I tried to use Git/Github on a good way:

- Branches with a clear name
- Pull request with clear summaries
- Clear commit messages
